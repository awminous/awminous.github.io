After over 6 years of our own professional experiences, we decided to combine our powers that will take your project from design to production.</p>

      <h3>Preproduction</h3>
      <p>Good ideas start with planning. In this process, we can map out the frames of your video projects through storyboarding; and we can design character turn-arounds and backgrounds to give you an idea of where the art will be headed.</p>
